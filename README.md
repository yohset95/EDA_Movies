# Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning in Movies Dataset
* This is my final project of IBM Machine Learning: Exploratory Data Analysis. </br>
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a process of findings fundamental characteristics and insights in a dataset. Thus, after EDA, we can perform data engineering and machine learning modelling.</br>
* For further details, the `.pdf` file has been attached for easy to read. </br>
* Lastly, the `.ipynb` (Python notebook) file is included for coding implementation. </br>
* Note:  If the notebook is failed to render through Github, then click [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/yohset95/EDA_Movies/blob/main/EDA_Movies_Beginners.ipynb)</br>

Happy reading!
